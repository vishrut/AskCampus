# AskCampus
CSCI 587 Project

AskCampus is a location based app which can be used to get location based information, for example, if one wants to go to the gym, he might want to know if the gym is crowded or not at that particular time. Similarly, it can be used for libraries, restaurants, study halls and other events.

Users who are at that specific location, can only answer the questions related to that location.
